ARDOLIA RPG BOT 
--------------

## ABOUT

Ardollia is a text game written in mIRC's scripting language.  This is a game of exploration where players will party up and go on adventures into dungeons, caverns and haunted forests. Their goal? Gain loot and fame while vanquishing evil monsters.

Once set up the game is entirely automatic and does not need anyone to run it.

A full in-depth guide with commands and more in-depth information will eventually be listed on this game's wiki.

Note: As of May 28, 2017 the game is still in heavy development and is not fully playable.


## SETUP

Getting it set up is easy.

 1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.  If you download the zip, unzip it into a folder of your choice (I recommend C:\Ardolia)
 2. Run the mirc.exe that is included.
 3. The bot will attempt to help you get things set up.  Set the bot owner's nick and the IRC channel you wish to game in.  Be sure to set a password for the bot that you'll register to nickserv with.
 4. (as with all mIRC programs) change the nickname and add a server
 5. Connect.
 6. Using another IRC connection as the bot owner's nick, join the game channel you set and use !new char (race)  without the () to get the character creation process started.
 7. Follow what the bot tells you to do. 

Note, you do NOT have to install it to C:\Ardolia\ However, it's recommended to make life simple.

   
## WHAT'S NEW?

For older updates please read the versions.txt: https://github.com/Iyouboushi/mIRC-Ardolia/blob/master/Ardolia/documentation/versions.txt

* AUG 01, 2017

Over the last few updates the game is getting closer to being in a playable state. With today's update the shop is 90% finished and the warrior abilities should be done and ready to go. 

## TO-DO

In order to make this game fully playable there are still a huge amount of things to be done.  Here's basically the list of things left that I want to have done before I would consider the game "playable"


* !shop commands (selling)

* Adding more armor and weapons for both WAR and WHM

* Creating several adventures for people to play up to level 10 (to start)

* A crafting system (though this isn't necessary for the game to be considered playable and can come later)

## THANKS

These are people who have helped me by helping me test, making monsters/weapons/etc, finding bugs, or just by giving me some ideas.  This bot would not as good/far along as it is without these fine folks.
