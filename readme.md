ARDOLIA RPG BOT 
--------------

## ABOUT

Ardollia is a text game written in mIRC's scripting language.  This is a game of exploration where players will party up and go on adventures into dungeons, caverns and haunted forests. Their goal? Gain loot and fame while vanquishing evil monsters.

Once set up the game is entirely automatic and does not need anyone to run it.

A full in-depth guide with commands and more in-depth information will eventually be listed on this game's wiki.

Note: As of May 20, 2017 the game is still in heavy development and is not fully playable.


## SETUP

Getting it set up is easy.

 1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.  If you download the zip, unzip it into a folder of your choice (I recommend C:\Ardolia)
 2. Run the mirc.exe that is included.
 3. The bot will attempt to help you get things set up.  Set the bot owner's nick and the IRC channel you wish to game in.  Be sure to set a password for the bot that you'll register to nickserv with.
 4. (as with all mIRC programs) change the nickname and add a server
 5. Connect.
 6. Using another IRC connection as the bot owner's nick, join the game channel you set and use !new char (race)  without the () to get the character creation process started.
 7. Follow what the bot tells you to do. 

Note, you do NOT have to install it to C:\Ardolia\ However, it's recommended to make life simple.

   
## WHAT'S NEW?

For older updates please read the versions.txt: https://github.com/Iyouboushi/mIRC-Ardolia/blob/master/Ardolia/documentation/versions.txt

* MAY 20, 2017

With today's update the spell and ability coding for attack, healing and buffing (both single target and AOE) should be finished.  The only thing left unfinished with these is inflicting status effects on the target (such as poison).

I also fixed a bug with the damage formulas that was causing both healing and damage to not be right.  It should be better now.

## TO-DO

In order to make this game fully playable there are still a huge amount of things to be done.  Up next is to make it so status effects can be inflicted and then working on the monster AI so they can use abilities and spells. 

## THANKS

These are people who have helped me by helping me test, making monsters/weapons/etc, finding bugs, or just by giving me some ideas.  This bot would not as good/far along as it is without these fine folks.
