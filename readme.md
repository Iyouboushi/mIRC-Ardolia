ARDOLIA RPG BOT 
--------------

## ABOUT

Ardollia is a text game written in mIRC's scripting language.  This is a game of exploration where players will party up and go on adventures into dungeons, caverns and haunted forests. Their goal? Gain loot and fame while vanquishing evil monsters.

Once set up the game is entirely automatic and does not need anyone to run it.

A full in-depth guide with commands and more in-depth information will eventually be listed on this game's wiki.

Note: As of November 2017 the game is playable but still in need of more content.


## SETUP

Getting it set up is easy.

 1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.  If you download the zip, unzip it into a folder of your choice (I recommend C:\Ardolia)
 2. Run the mirc.exe that is included.
 3. The bot will attempt to help you get things set up.  Set the bot owner's nick and the IRC channel you wish to game in.  Be sure to set a password for the bot that you'll register to nickserv with.
 4. (as with all mIRC programs) change the nickname and add a server
 5. Connect.
 6. Using another IRC connection as the bot owner's nick, join the game channel you set and use !new char (race)  without the () to get the character creation process started.
 7. Follow what the bot tells you to do. 

Note, you do NOT have to install it to C:\Ardolia\ However, it's recommended to make life simple.

   
## WHAT'S NEW?

For older updates please read the versions.txt: https://github.com/Iyouboushi/mIRC-Ardolia/blob/master/Ardolia/documentation/versions.txt

* SEPTEMBER 25, 2017

The game, at this point, is fully playable although there is still a lot of content left to be made and several descriptions of spells and abilities that need to be added.  

Specifically, this update adds the ability for adventures to be open for multiple days/months, spells and abilities that are buffs can be used without needing to specify a target, a few bugs were fixed, and !help stats added to help explain the various stats in the game.


## TO-DO

In order to consider the game "finished" or at least version 1.0 I would say that there are still a few things left to do.  In general:


* Adding more armor and weapons for the various jobs that are in the game 

* Creating more adventures for people to play

* A crafting system 


## THANKS

These are people who have helped me by helping me test, making monsters/weapons/etc, finding bugs, or just by giving me some ideas.  This bot would not as good/far along as it is without these fine folks.
