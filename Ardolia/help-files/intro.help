2Welcome.  By now you may have seen an ongoing adventure or a battle that was ongoing and may be wondering what's going on. 
2You are watching a new IRC game created by James ("Iyouboushi").  This game is basically an RPG inspired by Final Fantasy and MUDs that you can take a part in.
2The concept of this bot is to be fully automated, without needing a DM/GM/bot owner to be involved.
2Your mission is to create a character and go on adventures. Inside of the adventures you will encounter enemies to test your battle prowess. Defeating them and clearing the adventure will reward you with experience, weapons and armor.
