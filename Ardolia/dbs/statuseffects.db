=============================================
; This file is used to store the % chance
; and length of the various status effects
; in the game.  If you wish to adjust these
; feel free.  
;
; Chance = what chance do negative status effects
; have of affecting the target. 100 = 100% chance 
; of inflicting before modifiers.
;
; Length = how many turns the status effect
; will last. These are "real turns" so even
; if the battle ends the status effect will
; still be on until the next battle continues
; counting down the turns.
