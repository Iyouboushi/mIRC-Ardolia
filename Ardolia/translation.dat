[translation]
===================================================================
This is the translation file the bot uses for 
some of the messages used throughout.  If you want to
translate it into your native language, change the lines
to the right of the =  For example:

WaitYourTurn=TRANSLATE THIS PART

If you change the "WaitYourTurn" part, the bot will mess up.

Also make sure you leave any variables/commands alone.
Variables and commands look like this: %something or $something.  

$chr(3) is the character code for color.  The $+ # is the color
that the text will use.  You can change the # if you want to 
change the color.  Leave $chr(3) $+ or it won't work right.

Example:

$chr(3) $+ 4 $+ Text Here  
The "Text Here" will be red (color 4 in mIRC) If you change the
4 to a 2, you will have navy text instead of red.
